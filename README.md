# **Midnight Simplified — Tutorial dApps Collection**

A curated collection of simple, beginner-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) built using the **Compact smart contract language** on the **Midnight blockchain**.

This repository is part of the **Midnight Simplified** YouTube series, where each episode introduces new Midnight concepts through practical, real-world mini-projects.
Every project in this repo is intentionally small, easy to understand, and focused on one core learning goal.
